So this recreation has some extra perks:

Looks and feels like "real" reCAPTCHA (image from the official Google site)
Validation in the Run box to "hide" the command (âœ… "I am not a robot - reCAPTCHA Verification ID: 7624")
Disabled "Verify" button to further encourage users to complete the copy-paste steps. ðŸš«
Fleshed out phish with the follow-up windows "failed to verify"
Clears the clipboard so the payload command is removed.
Some code is reused from https://github.com/75a/fake-captcha

ðŸ¤” Other Musings
Perhaps this could be used within an iframe element, or easily embedded as a widget anywhere.
Perhaps this could have a bit more server-side control to check the client's user-agent and do things differently, or adjust the payload appropriately.
Perhaps this could be transformed into an easy Github Pages or Vercel tidbit to readily have a public domain and easy tooling
